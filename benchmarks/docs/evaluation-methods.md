# Evaluation methods

[Benchmark home](../README.md) · [Benchmark contracts](benchmark-contracts.md)

Jacobian evaluations are operator-run evidence exercises, not server features
or routine pull-request gates. Compare a control with no Jacobian against a
treatment that has only the public MCP surface. Hold the model, task inputs,
budget, environment, and repetitions fixed; do not turn the treatment into a
prescribed workflow.

Select the task set for the mathematical capabilities it reveals, not for how
well existing operations happen to fit it. The control/treatment comparison
then asks whether the current tool surface helps on that fixed capability set;
persistent failures are evidence for a future operation or environment change.

Each Harbor task owns its hidden verifier and Oracle. Author that contract from
the [task template](../templates/task/README.md) and
[benchmark contracts](benchmark-contracts.md); do not copy an existing task's
hidden `expected.json` predicate, lowest-terms wording, keyword gate, or
universal certificate union. Report mathematical correctness, tool use, failure
modes, cost, and the limits of the task set separately. Atomic mathematical task
correctness is normally binary; only explicit independent replayable subclaims
justify partial credit. An evaluation score or solver outcome is evidence about
the experiment, not a new mathematical conclusion returned by Jacobian.
