# Author a Harbor benchmark task

[Benchmark home](../README.md) · [Benchmark contracts](benchmark-contracts.md)

Harbor tasks are external evaluation assets. Choose a bounded, difficult
mathematical claim because it reveals a capability needed for serious
mathematical investigation, not because an existing Jacobian operation makes
it easy. A task can expose an operation gap; tool availability belongs in the
experimental treatment, not in the definition of a good task.

Copy [the task template](../templates/task/README.md) into a registered dataset.
Keep `instruction.md` and `environment/` agent-visible; keep `solution/` and
`tests/` Oracle/verifier-only. Do not copy an existing task's ceremonial
`answer.txt`, hidden `expected.json` predicate, keyword gate, or universal
certificate union into a new task.

## Write the public contract first

The agent-visible instruction and `environment/submission_schema.json` are the
complete rewarded protocol. They must agree with the verifier:

1. Default to a typed `result`. Add a `witness` only when replay needs a
   distinct finite object that is not already in `result`.
2. Put the smallest task-owned mathematical type in the schema: structured
   rationals, sparse maps, finite enums, or a family-specific certificate.
   Do not score `"2/8"` strings, formula prose, or keyword-bearing sentences.
3. State that equivalent encodings are accepted unless canonicalization is
   itself the mathematical outcome. Do not require lowest terms in public
   prose while the verifier constructs `Fraction`.
4. For a generated family, emit one schema licensed by that task's claim
   family. Do not publish a universal `oneOf` of every certificate kind.
5. Submit mathematics the verifier can replay. Do not require leaked answer
   constants, derived status fields, or `Claim COMPUTED` on a result-only
   schema. Closed success variants omit inapplicable failure fields; they do
   not send JSON `null`.
6. When a schema shrinks, update the instruction, verifier, gold, public
   contract, and host tests together. Align a mismatch by shrinking, never by
   restoring leaked fields. After merging `main`, re-read every touched
   `instruction.md` for truncated sentences and leftover contract fragments.

Declare the protocol in `tests/public_contract.json` and generate the marked
submission block plus schema with `benchmarks.tooling.public_contract`. Do not
hand-maintain a second protocol.

## Implement replay, not a gold comparison

The verifier recomputes or checks the claim from the frozen `input.json` copy
and the submitted value. Keep `tests/expected.json` as an Oracle regression
fixture only. A function that loads both input and expected, then scores
equality with hidden expected fields while ignoring the input, is not a
mathematical verifier.

Normalize represented values before comparison: unreduced rationals, scaled
rational functions, and unordered collections (sets, maps, sparse polynomials,
distributions) unless order is part of the public object. Reject booleans as
integers, zero or negative denominators under the stated sign convention, and
resource-bound violations.

Do not award credit for:

- a preferred rendering of an already-checked value;
- substrings, length, or negation regexes over mathematical prose;
- a digest, field copy, or nonempty file that only restates `result`;
- an unread `answer.txt` whose path and hash are the only checks.

Independent propositions must be derived independently. Do not couple a
collision, invertibility, or completeness claim to an unrelated corrupted
field. If input binding is a separate diagnostic, parse the submission without
requiring workspace-input equality, replay math against the frozen tests
input, and AND binding only into `reward`. Gold witness descriptors must
resolve to regular files under a non-symlink `solution/` root.

## Validate the exact task

```sh
make harbor-prepare-task DATASET=<dataset-id> TASKS="<task-id>"
make harbor-validate-task DATASET=<dataset-id> TASKS="<task-id>"
```

`harbor-prepare-task` formats selected task Python and refreshes public-contract
and verifier checksums. The checksum hashes filenames, NUL separators, and
bytes; do not concatenate `sha256(verifier.py)` with
`sha256(verifier_support.py)`, and do not rewrite every task-local support
copy. `harbor-validate-task` is the source-read-only leaf gate: static
contracts, host tests, then the exact Oracle. Neither command starts a model.
Use `make harbor-check` only when changing shared Harbor tooling, schemas,
registry, or suite policy. Do not exclude Harbor host-verifier tests from
unsupported-surface AST or text scans merely because they spawn a verifier
subprocess. Create a snapshot lock only when freezing an intentional
evaluation or publication set.

The task's verifier owns correctness; Jacobian owns neither that verifier nor
its data lifecycle. Keep the task's score distinct from Jacobian's two-tool
operation contract.
