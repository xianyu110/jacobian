# jacobian

A thin deterministic npm carrier for
[Jacobian](https://github.com/morluto/jacobian): the MCP server, CLI, and
Python library that exposes a portfolio of composable operations with
mathematically atomic, agent-visible outcomes to AI agents investigating
conjectures and other mathematical problems.

This package does not implement the kernel, install Python, or manage
environments. Its `mcp` command is a thin deterministic carrier; its separate
`setup` command configures a reviewed, explicitly selected set of MCP client
registrations. It exists because the
[MCP Registry](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry) metadata
(`server.json`) publishes `npx jacobian mcp` as the installable carrier for the
stdio server. The carrier invokes exactly one canonical Python command.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 18
- `uv` on `$PATH` (or set `JACOBIAN_UV_BIN`)

## Install

```sh
npm install -g jacobian
```

Install, upgrade, and remove this carrier with npm.

## Set up agents

Set up Jacobian for your agents with a single command. It requires Node.js 18
or newer and `uvx` on your `PATH`.

```sh
npx jacobian@latest setup
```

Choose detected agents and review the changes before they are written. Setup
writes only a `jacobian` MCP entry for selected agents; existing unowned
entries are protected unless you explicitly pass `--force`.

The generated launcher pins the Jacobian version that ran setup. Setup itself
does not install or upgrade Node.js, `uv`, Python, or an agent.

For automation, make selection and consent explicit:

```sh
npx jacobian@latest setup --codex --dry-run
npx jacobian@latest setup --codex --yes
```

## Usage

```sh
jacobian mcp [args...]
  Run the canonical Jacobian MCP server over stdio.

jacobian setup [options]
  Configure selected agents to use the Jacobian MCP server.
```

`jacobian mcp` execs the exact canonical command:

```sh
uvx --from jacobian==<version> jacobian-mcp [args...]
```

The npm package version is the single release manifest. The carrier maps it to
the matching Python package spec and pins it for `uvx`, so a reproducible
deployment never floats `latest`. `uvx` owns the ephemeral Python environment;
this carrier does not.

## Environment

- `JACOBIAN_UV_BIN`: override the `uvx` executable used to launch the server.
- `JACOBIAN_PACKAGE`: override the pinned Python package spec (default:
  `jacobian==<version>` matching this carrier).

## Results

Each operation returns its own bounded mathematical outcome: an exact value,
an incomplete result, or an unknown/non-conclusion when its declared scope is
not enough. The carrier only launches Jacobian; it does not reinterpret or
upgrade an operation result.
