SERVER_DESCRIPTION = (
    "Search and run atomic, composable Jacobian tools for higher mathematics."
)

SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = (
    "Jacobian provides local typed operations for mathematical computation and "
    "structural analysis. Reach for math.find and math.run proactively when a problem "
    "contains an exact computation, finite search, or structural analysis that may "
    "match an installed operation. Use math.find to discover or inspect operations and "
    "math.run to execute them; compose returned values with Python for multi-step work."
)

MATH_FIND_DESCRIPTION = """\
Search, browse, or inspect locally installed Jacobian math tools. This is authoritative
for local discovery and exact operation inspection; internet search is not. Use math.find
when a task may benefit from exact computation, search, or structural analysis.

Forms:
- `request.op="search"`: plain-language mathematical outcome (compact cards).
- `request.op="browse"`: compact operation cards in operation-ID order, optionally
  filtered to one domain; use this to map an unfamiliar domain.
- `search` accepts optional `domain` and `limit` 1-20 (default 5); `browse` accepts
  the same filters (default limit 20).
- Follow `next_cursor` with the same search query or browse filters to continue.
- Ranking is deterministic lexical retrieval; matches are not recommendations.
- `request.op="inspect"`: exact ID with authoritative schemas and examples.
- `operation://catalog` remains an exact bulk export, not the ordinary discovery path.

Examples:
- `{"request":{"op":"search","query":"exact matrix determinant","domain":"matrix","limit":3}}`
- `{"request":{"op":"browse","domain":"matrix","limit":20}}`
- `{"request":{"op":"search","query":"counterexample to associativity"}}`
- `{"request":{"op":"search","query":"check a bounded Lean source snippet","domain":"lean"}}`
- `{"request":{"op":"inspect","operation_id":"polynomial.compute.gcd"}}`
"""

MATH_RUN_DESCRIPTION = """\
Run one installed math tool by ID with its typed `payload`. A successful call returns
the operation-owned mathematical value in `output`; read its fields to determine what
the calculation established. MCP reports malformed payloads, unknown IDs, and host
failures as tool errors, not as mathematical results. If the payload shape is unknown,
inspect the exact operation with math.find. When it publishes an `examples` item, copy
and adapt that item's `input` object as the `payload`; otherwise, form the payload from
the input schema and its field descriptions. Do not call math.run with an empty
`payload` merely to discover required fields; inspection is authoritative.

Timeout, incomplete search, and missing witnesses appear only in the concrete domain
result that owns them; none is a mathematical conclusion by itself.

Examples:
- `{"operation_id":"integer.compute.extended_gcd","payload":{"left":"84","right":"30"}}`
